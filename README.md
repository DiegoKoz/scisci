The DOI's can be used to extract the full metadata of articles with Scopus API, following [code/dataset/1_data_retrival.ipynb](code/1_dataset/1_data_retrival.ipynb).


This repository also contains 2 Embeddings based on the dataset using BERT and GCN-GAE. The embedding representation and DOI's are in the same order in both files. 


## code

the code is divided into three steps:

1. dataset
2. models
3. ablation study


The great part of the code was implemented as libraries under the libs/ folder. Each section contains one of such folder, and several sorted Jupyter Notebooks that implement some specific step using the .py files in libs/ 

In order to reproduce the results, the scripts should be run in the order described by the folders and files. In order to retrieve the dataset from Scopus, the user must have the proper API Keys. The original dataset can be send prior written authorisation from Scopus.

	abstract = {Over the last century, we observe a steady and exponential growth of scientific publications globally. The overwhelming amount of available literature makes a holistic analysis of the research within a field and between fields based on manual inspection impossible. Automatic techniques to support the process of literature review are required to find the epistemic and social patterns that are embedded in scientific publications. In computer sciences, new tools have been developed to deal with large volumes of data. In particular, deep learning techniques open the possibility of automated end-to-end models to project observations to a new, low-dimensional space where the most relevant information of each observation is highlighted. Using deep learning to build new representations of scientific publications is a growing but still emerging field of research. The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential and limits of deep learning for gathering insights about scientific research articles. We focus on document-level embeddings based on the semantic and relational aspects of articles, using Natural Language Processing ({NLP}) and Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}). We explore the different outcomes generated by those techniques. Our results show that using {NLP} we can encode a semantic space of articles, while {GNN} we enable us to build a relational space where the social practices of a research community are also encoded.},
